						India is the 4th largest construction equipment market in the world and is
						growing at a CAGR of approximately 11%. Although the growth rate has
						increased significantly, the industry is facing major challenges because of
						acute shortage of skilled service technicians, resulting in Increase in
						downtime of the equipment due to increased mean time to repair, Higher
						equipment failure rates and increased life cycle costs. In the current case,
						the bottleneck for customer was Down-time of the equipment due to :
					</h4>
					<h4 className="H4 color-2" style={{fontSize: "20px"}}>
						(a) Inability to repair and maintain equipment, <br /> (b) Frequent
						breakdown of equipment.
					</h4>
					<h4 className="H4 py-4 color-2" style={{fontSize: "20px"}}>
						As a consequence of the complexity of the equipment operations and frequent
						changes in manpower due to high attrition rate, the service technicians were
						not able to reach the required level of expertise to keep the equipment
						running, resulting in high penalties, loss in service revenue and frequent
						breakdown of the equipment.
